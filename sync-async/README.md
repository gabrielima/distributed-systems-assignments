# Sync/Async Example

This is an extremely simple example of how sync and async requests work on the web.

### Testing

For the async example, you need to test it on a server. If you have python installed on your machine, cd into the sync/async directory and type

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

It will create a server, usually at port 8000, and serve the content of that folder.
